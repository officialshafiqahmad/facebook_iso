## Work devision:

Ilanit: Project management via Jira: adding the tasks and dividing work into subtasks. Designing the layout for the login and registration screens considering options for navigation between them. Added some feed features after the merge. Allowed users to logout, created the design for adding posts and comments and made some general fixes in the code. Writing the tests for the react components and the basic functions.
Ori and I worked together on merging our parts and faced some technical difficulties. Making the components work together and running smoothly after the merge. Added user navigation after implementing correct user authentication logic.

Ori: Designing the layout for the feed screen in the web and the Android, considering elements such as post previews, user avatars, like/share/comment buttons and functionalities: adding and deleting comments and etc, menu for the share button, and a menu for navigation options: adding new post, supporting light/dark mode, responsible for the working search line, Develop functionality to fetch posts from a local JSON file and display them in the feed screen. Ensure smooth scrolling and efficient loading of posts. In the post responsible for the options for editing and deleting posts, wrote all the Jira tasks for the feed subject, all in the web and Android.

Shmuel: Login and registration components on Android. Design the layout for the login and registration screen, including input fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation, along with a register and login button Ensure secure storage and handling of user registration data.

Ilanit and Shmuel had similar parts in different technologies which allowed us to work together as a team and implement similar logic ideas. It allowed us to see the similarities and the differences between the two technologies.
